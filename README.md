# Currency Calculator (React + Express)

This project is a currency converter application consisting of two main components: a REST API built with Express.js and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using React.js.
The API provides endpoints for converting currencies, as well as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage currencies and their exchange rates. The API also includes basic authentication and authorization to protect certain endpoints.
The UI allows users to easily convert currencies, add new currencies, or update existing ones, using a simple form. Users must log in to access the protected CRUD operations for currencies.
